# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the **Subject**) changes its state, all its dependents (called **Observers**) are notified and updated automatically.

## Key Components

- **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.
- **Observer**: Defines an interface for receiving updates from the subject.
- **ConcreteSubject**: Implements the subject interface and keeps track of observers.
- **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the observer interface and updates its state based on notifications.

## Use Cases

Commonly used in scenarios like event handling systems, MVC architecture, and real-time updates.

## Example

A classic example is a notification system (**Subject**) that notifies subscribers (**Observers**) about updates depending on the system.
